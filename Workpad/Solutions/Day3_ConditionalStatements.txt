Objective
In this challenge, we learn about conditional statements.

Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If  is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, n

Constraints
1 <= n <= 100

Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0
3
Sample Output 0
Weird

Sample Input 1
24
Sample Output 1
Not Weird
