I first want to say that the C++ compiler in HackerRank's editor is absolute shit.  
The "Problem" section as well as the examples and explanations are also incorrect in some spots.  In any event, here is the Problem write-up for this day's problem.

Objective
In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators.

ask
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

Example
mealCost = 100
tipPercent = 15
taxPercent = 8

A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value 123 and return from the function.

Function Description
Complete the solve function in the editor below.

solve has the following parameters:

int mealCost: the cost of food before tip and tax
int tipPercent: the tip percentage
int taxPercent: the tax percentage
Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.

Input Format

There are 3 lines of numeric input:
The first line has a double, mealCost (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
The second line has an integer, tipPercent (the percentage of mealCost being added as tip).
The third line has an integer, taxPercent (the percentage of mealCost being added as tax).

Sample Input

12.00
20
8
Sample Output

15
